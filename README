duhast ("du hast") is a going to be a framework for manipulating source code
at the level of the lexical token stream or at the level of the abstract
syntax tree.  We're probably just going to work with haskell at first.  So
we're going to connect to the haskell-src-exts lexer and parser and build
utility functions on top of that.

And yes, this is a reboot of lexpass except that was slow (probably mostly
for using parsec instead of yacc) and php-specific (reinventing the parser
for better and worse).
